# Welcome to my First Blog in Github

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my journey to being a programmer.

Week 1: The world is now in pandemic. I'm currently in my house studying programming. I know a few things about programming, but I still have a lot to learn. I'm familiarizing myself with Github and I'm currently practicing programming in Python.
